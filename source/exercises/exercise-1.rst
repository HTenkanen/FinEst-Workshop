Exercises 1-3
=============

**Objectives:** These exercises help you to get a hands-on experience in using the open source tools in Python.
I recommend you to do the Exercise 1 first, but after that you can pick an exercise that interests you the most.

Exercise 1
----------

Run the :doc:`first tutorial <../notebooks/geoprocessing/intro-to-python-geostack>` that demonstrates how to work with spatial data in Python.

Exericse 2
----------

Run the :doc:`second tutorial <../notebooks/data_access/intro-to-WFS>` that demonstrates how to fetch data via WFS to geopandas GeoDataFrames.

Exericse 3
----------

If you still have time, run any other of the tutorials which interest you under the ``Data Processing with Python`` or ``Getting geospatial data to Python`` sections.
